				  	<h2>Volleyball</h2>
				  	<p>I am passionate about volleyball; I have been playing for 7 years now. What I like the most in this sport is the team spirit and the cohesion that can be created on the field. I also think that this is a very interesting game that requires a real game strategy to win.

				  	<h2>Running</h2>
				  	<p>I also love running, it's a sport that for me differs a lot from team sports or other activities because it's about going beyond your own limits. it's a sport that depends only on ourselves and our will. It's a passion because it's a sport that brings me a lot of satisfaction and allows me to constantly set myself goals to achieve.

				  	<h2>Theatre</h2>
				  	<p>I love theatre, for me it's a livelier version of cinema. There is an energy to the theater that differs from the screens. Doing theater allows you to express yourself in a different way from your daily life. Watching a play allows you to have a different vision, and perspective of things.

				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>I like to travel, it makes me get out of my comfort zone. Go to various exotic places allows me to take a step back from my vision of things and my life in general. It is also in my opinion a way to open up to others and live enriching experiences.
